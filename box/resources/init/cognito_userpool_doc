## This API is secured using a AWS cognito userpool

### Cognito userpool

To call any API methods with a user pool enabled, API clients must perform the following tasks:

*   Use the Amazon Cognito CLI/SDK or API to sign a user in to the chosen user pool, and obtain an identity 
token or access token.
*   Use a client-specific framework to call the deployed API Gateway API and supply the appropriate token in 
the Authorization header.

The API developer must provide the client developers with the user pool ID, a client ID, and possibly the associated 
client secrets that are defined as part of the user pool. Format of a well known URL of an AWS cognito userpool : 
https://cognito-idp.[region].amazonaws.com/[userpool-id]/.well-known/openid-configuration
