## Access to this API is controlled by AWS resource policies

### AWS Resource Policies

Amazon API Gateway resource policies are JSON policy documents that are attached to an API to control whether 
a specified principal (typically an IAM user or role) can invoke the API. API Gateway resource policies can be 
used to allow an API to be securely invoked by:

*   Users from a specified AWS account.
*   Specified source IP address ranges or CIDR blocks.
*   Specified virtual private clouds (VPCs) or VPC endpoints (in any account).

For more information on resource policies refer here: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-resource-policies.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-resource-policies.html)
