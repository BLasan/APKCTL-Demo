## This API is secured using AWS signature version 4

### How AWS Signature Version 4 works

1.  Create a canonical request.
2.  Use the canonical request and additional metadata to create a string for signing.
3.  Derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. Then use the signing key, and the string from 
    the previous step, to create a signature.
4.  Add the resulting signature to the HTTP request in a header or as a query string parameter.

##### Important

When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools 
automatically sign the requests for you with the security credentials you specify when you configure the tools.
 When you use these tools, you don't need to learn how to sign requests yourself. However, when you manually create 
 HTTP requests to access AWS services, you must sign requests that require signing yourself.

##### Signing requests

To sign a request, you first calculate a hash (digest) of the request. Then you use the hash value, some other information 
from the request, and your secret access key to calculate another hash known as the signature. Then you add the signature 
to the request in one of the following ways:

*   Using the HTTP Authorization header.
*   Adding a query string value to the request. Because the signature is part of the URL in this case, this type of URL is 
called a presigned URL.
